registry.py
x    entity class registry
x    register decorators  
x    access entity classes by category etc
x    allow entity to be spawned without importing
        take a kwargs and pass it to the constructor with a copy of the kwargs that the entity can store for spawning children or w/e i am like 51% sure this is a good idea that i have, in the past, yearned for.

unfuck the cursor

debug console
x    pause simulation
    list entities in a pane
    show player, camera location
x    spawn entities
    inspect entities
    make unkillable
    give bean/lore
    etc

make the player pick up the sord at the start to start spawning happening

better body management for add/remove to facilite arbitrary structures and merging

figure out the right way to do collision
    need to be able to quickly get any pair of entities that collided

boss 1

camera movement mechanics

geographical support conditions
    parameters for controlling spawning by location
    max number of <entity>
    scaling coefficients
    that kind of thing
    tunable parameters used by spawner entities to make
    spawn decisions that vary with position (of the camera)

spawner entities
    spawn enemies when within range of camera
